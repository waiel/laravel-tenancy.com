Migrations are extremely important in the Laravel ecosystem. To facilitate
tenants with this flow, without interfering with its logic migration commands
for tenants have been given their own namespace `tenancy:`.

##### About the database/migrations path

It's not wise to store the tenants migrations inside your global
`database/migrations` directory. Laravel by default runs these migrations
when calling the `php artisan migrate` command. Even though you can suggest
a connection during that command, it's much cleaner to store these migrations
inside a separate directory, e.g. `database/migrations/tenant`. 
The migrations for the system database can stay in `database/migrations`.

##### Default migrations for new tenants

If you want new tenants to be migrated by default, you can easily do so. In
your `tenancy.php` configuration set `db > tenant-migrations-path` to a valid
absolute path and all your new tenants will run these migrations per default.

```php
  // ..
  "tenant-migrations-path" => database_path('migrations/tenant'),
  // ..
```

##### Default seeds for newly auto-migrated tenants

In case you would also like to seed the databases of your newly created
and migrated tenants, you can enable `db > tenant-seed-class` in your `tenancy.php`
configuration file. Change this setting to a fully namespaced class name
and the package will automatically run this seed after it has ran the
automatic migrations.

##### Migration related commands

Obviously tenancy is also able to run migrations running through artisan.

Each of the native Laravel migrate and seed command has its tenancy
counterpart, for instance.

- `tenancy:migrate`
- `tenancy:db:seed`

Please check their separate signatures for more information of valid arguments
and options.

> Running tenancy:migrate without any path or realpath option and 
without having configured tenant-migration-path will migrate your 
tenants with the files inside the database/migrations directory.
